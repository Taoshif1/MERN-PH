# üöÄ Module 37: React App 2 - Core Concepts and Data Fetching

This project is a React application built with **Vite**, focusing on key React concepts including **component creation**, **state management (`useState`)**, **event handling**, and modern data fetching using **Suspense** and the **`use()` hook**.

---

## üß† Concepts Learned

This project provided hands-on experience with fundamental and advanced React topics:

* **Components:** Building reusable UI parts (`Users`, `Counter`, `Batsman`).
* **JSX:** Writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
* **Props:** Passing data and functions between components.
* **State:** Managing component data over time using the `useState` hook.
* **Events:** Handling user interactions (clicks) in various ways.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying different UI elements based on state (e.g., showing a congratulatory message).

---

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

This application demonstrates several core capabilities of a React application:

### 1. Dynamic Data Fetching (Suspense & `use` Hook)

* **Users List:** Fetched **10 user records** from the `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` API. Data is passed to the `<Users>` component via **Props**.
* **Modern Fetching:** Utilizes the modern **`use()` hook** combined with the `<Suspense>` boundary to manage the loading state, providing a smooth user experience.
* **Posts:** Implemented logic to fetch 100 post records from the API, which is currently commented out in the main component for a cleaner initial display.

### 2. Interactive Components & State Management

* **`Counter` Component:** A fully functional counter with an **Add** button, demonstrating basic `useState` functionality.
* **`Batsman` Component:** A specialized component simulating a batsman's score.
    * Buttons for **Single**, **Double**, **4**, and **6** update the total score.
    * Features **Conditional Rendering** to display a congratulatory message when the score exceeds 50!

### 3. Diverse Event Handling

The app showcases five different methods for handling button clicks in React:

1.  **Normal Function:** (`handleClick`)
2.  **Arrow Function:** (`handleClick3`)
3.  **Anonymous Function in `onClick`:** (`handleClick2`)
4.  **Inline Arrow Function in `onClick`:** (Click Me 4)
5.  **Passing Arguments via Arrow Function:** (Click to ADD 5, which adds 5 to a fixed number 9 and shows the result in an alert).
